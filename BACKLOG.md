# Backlog

Living backlog for the mutualist Bluesky feed.

## Product goals

- **Precision:** Keep out ancap / chaos / speculative-crypto false friends,
  revolutionary coercion, empty scenetalk, and personal fundraising wrapped as
  “mutual aid.”
- **Recall:** Surface inspiring **proto-anarchist** / decentralized-leftist
  content — including authors who never say “anarchist” — plus allowlisted
  collectives and mutual-aid *praxis*.
- **Quality rubric:** Ambiguous leftovers, latent compound latches, and
  solicit-shaped provisional keeps are scored by DeepSeek (`deepseek-v4-flash`)
  on thematic fit, positive valence, wow factor, and solicit intensity.
- **Tone:** Prefer constructive, respectable, high-wow posts. Governance is to
  be spread out, humanized, and voluntarized — not abolished as a slogan, and
  not replaced by state-capacity politics.

## Active roadmap — proto-anarchist reclaim

## P0 — Ship / harden v1

### B-001 — Grow allowlist of aligned orgs
- Curate publishers, IWW branches, Food Not Bombs chapters, infoshops, mutual-aid
  networks. Screen with `scripts/screen_allowlist_candidates.py`.
- Keep DIDs in sync via `scripts/resolve_allowlist_dids.py`.
- Roadmap expansion: [#13](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/mutualist-bluesky-feed/issues/13).

### B-002 — Expand eval set from live near-misses
- Sample with `collect_eval_sample.py` (authors / near-miss / events).
- Optional LLM proposals via `llm_label_judge.py` — human confirm before append.
- Latent/proto stratum: [#6](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/mutualist-bluesky-feed/issues/6).

### B-003 — Tune quality-rubric gates on holdout
- Log classifier keep/drop reasons (incl. `quality_reject:*` / solicit cues).
- Adjust thematic / valence / wow / solicit / composite gates only with
  stratified eval evidence.
- Prompt thesis rewrite: [#8](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/mutualist-bluesky-feed/issues/8).

### B-004 — Publish + Fly cutover
- `publish_feed.py` with real credentials on an operator machine.
- Set `FEED_URI` + `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` on Fly; verify `did.json` + skeleton.

## P1 — Quality

### B-010 — Multilingual anarchist terms
- Spanish/French/German strong positives and hard negatives.

### B-011 — Soft-prior analytics
- Dashboard or script for authors approaching the soft-prior threshold.
- Latent-keep flywheel: [#14](https://github.com/chriscarrollsmith/mutualist-bluesky-feed/issues/14).

### B-013 — Quality rubric ranking
- Optionally store grade breakdowns on indexed posts and soft-boost wow /
  valence in `RANKING_MODE` experiments once the index is non-empty.
